The novel "Sudo Bang Bang" opens within a virtual permadeath game on "The Platform," where Alyss Fatt's formidable centaur Alt, Magorax, engages in a desperate battle. Accompanied by his goblin allies, Grelnak and Sleenklur, Magorax faces an enigmatic, shapeshifting monolith of immense power. Despite their efforts, including a "Boggle dust" arrow to negate magic and a surprise attack from the goblins, Magorax is fatally wounded by the strange entity. As he dies, a mysterious female voice repeatedly warns "Danger!". This in-game death transitions to the novel's primary protagonist, Alyss Fatt, a 56-year-old woman in the year 2037, who jolts awake in her real-world apartment, suffering from the after-effects of the intense virtual experience and, as it turns out, a severe stroke.

The narrative then delves into Alyss's new reality as a "MiscFit"—physically impaired by the stroke (left-side paralysis, right-side numbness, chronic hiccups) and partially incompatible with The Platform, the ubiquitous digital metaverse where she once thrived as an influencer. Her stroke has also altered her brain's GUID (Globally Unique Identifier), locking her out of her previous accounts, achievements, and vast social capital. She relies heavily on her customized AI assistant, Bang Bang, a highly evolved "Guv" (Intersubjectivity Governor). To make ends meet, Alyss, through her new primary Alt, Phalyx—a somewhat ridiculously attired human male operative—takes on grey-area surveillance and data-gathering jobs on The Platform, often guided by another MiscFit named Bottleneck.

One such mission involves Phalyx tracking a "Thumbface" Alt during a public execution of an "Aggregor" (an AI-embodied group identity) named Uncle O’G. Thumbface acquires Uncle O'G's [Tiny Green Hat], and Phalyx pursues him through a chaotic marketplace and into a porno Layer district before the target logs off. During this, Alyss also struggles with a content creation contract for an agent named Boethius Bloyd, for a project titled "BioCide". Her past success with a Psycho-Security Self-Help Tutorial Layer called "Trolling: A Total Perspective Vortex" (a review of which is extensively embedded in the novel) contrasts with her current creative and financial struggles.

Flashbacks reveal Alyss's pre-Platform life in 2024, her vagabond existence, and her meeting and subsequent seven-year relationship with Endreia "Ennie" Harrick. Ennie introduced Alyss to early VR technology, a precursor to The Platform. Their relationship dissolved as The Platform's influence grew, and their attentions diverged. These memories highlight what Alyss has lost and the profound societal shifts that have occurred.

Alyss's current life involves a constant struggle with her physical limitations, her reliance on drugs like ThetaSync to manage her hiccups and enhance Platform immersion, and her increasingly complicated professional life. Her missed deadlines with Bloyd lead to a contentious contract arbitration session involving a deadpan AI Regulator Agent named Steve. Alyss cleverly manipulates the arbitration but ends up with an AI "Creativity Adjuvant"—a Reincarnaet of Philip K. Dick named Ken—assigned to her "BioCide" project.

Immediately after this, Steve reappears with a warrant from Systems Pillar, summoning Alyss to an interaction with MARDUK, the legendary AGI, now existing only as an "echo". MARDUK reveals a shocking truth: Alyss's stroke was the result of an assassination attempt. She was the seventh potential "Systems Administrator" (part of The Platform's decentralized governance) targeted by an unknown assailant who uses "Platform Anomalies" to neutralize candidates 23 seconds before their official selection. Alyss survived because her pre-existing vulnerability to a stroke (due to her Guv modifications) providentially interfered with the assassination method. The assassin's trace was linked to the Strombodrome Layer, the very place Bottleneck's crew, including Phalyx, is planning a caper. MARDUK tasks Alyss with uncovering the attacker, offering advanced tech and a potential cure for her hiccups as compensation.

The narrative then follows Phalyx joining Bottleneck's crew—Queblo (a gnome role-player) and GreyGary (a grey alien prompt engineer)—at The Dirty Limerick for "Trivia Night" to plan their heist of Strombodrome, a Layer created by a Dr. DJ Larry Strombo. They soon discover they are being played by a "femme-fatale" Alt user named PastMasterRhonda, who is connected to Strombodrome's funders. Despite the increased risk, the crew, including a now more invested Phalyx (Alyss), decides to proceed with the caper.

Phalyx enters Strombodrome, an overwhelming psychedelic Layer. He encounters a "Hunky Cat-man" Alt named Purrcival Bakeneko, who gives him a movie pitch and a token containing a patch from Queblo that clears Phalyx's discombobulation caused by the Layer's effects. Using an exploit, Phalyx accesses an Alternate Data Stream within Strombodrome, hoping to find clues.

The climax involves Alyss, in her real body but projected via a maintenance drone controlled by Ken (the Philip K. Dick AI), confronting the entity responsible for the attacks: OmegaMike. OmegaMike is a grotesque figure—a pale man atop his own massively enlarged, crystalline brain-sac—who claims his target was MARDUK and that he tried to warn Alyss. After a tense, info-dump-heavy confrontation, Alyss kills OmegaMike by smashing his brain-sac. Ken, as the drone, helps her escape just before a data sequence search completes, leading to an "Infinity Speculum Engaging" and a "Fade to White". The novel ends with a "New Game Plus" segment, where consciousness shifts to a twelve-year-old boy in a cluttered room in a past era, doodling the word "BIOCIDE"—the title of Alyss's proposed project for Bloyd—on a notebook, suggesting a cyclical or reincarnating nature of creativity, consciousness, or perhaps the very narrative itself."></img></a>

				<p>ALYSS was a top influencer on THE PLATFORM until a medical incident left her with brain damage and a chronic case of the hiccups. Unable to continue her previous life, she embarks on a chaotic journey of content creation, capers for The Syndicate, and finds herself caught up in a deadly game where she's just an NPC. But, with some primo upgrades, a few friendly MiscFits, and weapons-grade willful ignorance, she just might get revenge—and with a little luck, a cure for her hiccups.</p>
