Fabrina Glitchlace's "Footprints in the Worm Garden" introduces us to "The Little One," later called Runt, a young inhabitant of a subterranean society structured in layers, such as Riemann-Beta Layer-715.  The story commences with deep familial and societal upheaval following the death of Runt's father. At a solemn gathering in a sacred cathedral, the Chief Caucus Cleric reads the father's will, a document Runt finds meaningless as it predates her birth and makes no provision for her, yet is declared immutable law.  The will dictates that the clan must provide a successor to compete in "The League," a role for which Runt's athletic older sister, Sprout, has been groomed.  Runt, feeling overlooked and resentful of the rigid traditions ("Our way, be done" ), openly protests, calling the elders a "mob of drongos,"  much to the chagrin of her mother and sister.

Fleeing the ceremony, Runt traverses the familiar tunnels of her home, her path lit by glowbugs and "lectriks."  She takes a shortcut through Mr. Khorzo's worm garden, a recurring act of minor rebellion.  The family dynamics are tense; Runt feels her mother and sister are against her, and she is not interested in the competitive pursuits valued by her father and Sprout.  Her Uncle Jowr, her father's brother, a somewhat past-his-prime former athlete with a jovial but opportunistic demeanor, arrives.  He had given chase after Runt left the cathedral.

The following morning, the family confronts Runt about her outburst and trespassing.  Uncle Jowr proposes a solution to satisfy the will: he will use his old contacts to get Sprout a contract in The League in the Delta layer.  As part of this plan, Runt is to take over Jowr's role as Keeper of the clan's Peeve.  Runt is dismayed, as this means she can no longer afford to participate in the choir, her passion.  Despite her protests that the traditions are "stupid,"  her mother, Gloria, insists this is "how it has to be," citing their way and scripture.  A physical altercation between Runt and Sprout ensues, culminating in Runt storming off.

Runt accompanies Uncle Jowr on a several-hour journey to his estate on Layer 733.  During the journey, Jowr explains the history of Peeves: sacred animals, givers of good luck, with a long tradition of Keepers.  Their clan's Peeve was a prize from a championship won 136 seasons before Runt's birth.  Upon arrival, Jowr instructs Runt to clean the cluttered ceremonial rotunda where the Peeve is housed, except for the Peeve and its tank.

Runt enters the musty, humid rotunda and sees the Peeve for the first time since infancy.  It's a repulsive, "living loaf" of pale, rotting fleshrags, with sparse fur, waxy skin, and an oily, slimy coating.  Despite its appearance, it possesses a "presence."  Runt diligently cleans Jowr's hoarded junk from the rotunda.  Jowr returns and explains the Keeper duties: feed the Peeve one bucket of worms every twenty-three cycles (it doesn't drink, absorbing moisture from the air, and never poops); massage it five times each cycle until it purrs and stops moving; and every forty cycles, extract "green cream" from its "oxterproglia," which is sold at market. 

Runt begins her duties alone after Jowr leaves for business.  She finds the work itself not difficult, but struggles with the rhythm and the solitude.  She thoroughly cleans and renovates the rotunda, discovering a beautiful mosaic on the ceiling.  While singing in the acoustically improved chamber, she hears a faint humming accompanying her.  She initially dismisses it but later, while petting the Peeve and singing "Tiptoe Through the Tulips," she realizes the Peeve is purring and rumbling in sync with her song.  Suddenly, the Peeve convulses, honks "Ree... HONK" repeatedly,  then turns itself inside-out, spewing its guts towards the ceiling and ejecting black ooze before retracting everything.  Slimed and terrified, Runt flees back to her mother on Layer 715. 

Her mother, Gloria, calmly suggests the Peeve might have sneezed due to dust from Runt's cleaning.  Runt, somewhat mollified, agrees to return the next day.  Sprout, surprisingly, offers to accompany Runt for a cycle before she leaves for The League with Uncle Jowr.  During this visit, Gloria reveals her distrust of Jowr, recounting how he tried to sell the Peeve to Runt's father years ago. 

Back at Jowr's, Runt and Sprout clean the mess. The Peeve appears healthier.  Runt demonstrates the petting, and the Peeve purrs.  That evening, Sprout takes Runt to a concert at Gold Digger Arena, an old, disused League venue.  They see a band called The Bunyips, and Sprout participates in "The Scrumm," a frenetic dance.  Runt meets Sprout's friends: Del (the horn player), Ezen, and Dumbchuck.  Sprout acts uncharacteristically affectionate.  Runt, suspicious, returns to the arena after initially leaving and discovers Sprout and Del in a romantic embrace, planning to leave together that night for the "topmost layers of Alpha," not Delta for The League.  Sprout confesses she doesn't want the life prescribed by tradition and invites Runt to find her when she's older. 

Runt returns to the rotunda, late for a petting session. The Peeve looks even healthier.  She sings to it again.  The next evening, Uncle Jowr returns, ecstatic about The Peeve's magically improved condition, which he attributes to Runt being a "natural" Keeper.  He excitedly proposes a new plan: after taking Sprout to The League (unaware she has fled), he and Runt will take the rejuvenated Peeve to Epsilon and open a "Pilgrimnaisuim," abandoning Gloria.  Runt is disgusted by his self-interest and dismissal of her mother and sister.  As Jowr tries to persuade her, Runt notices the Peeve's tank is empty.  The Peeve, camouflaged against the mosaic ceiling, drops down and engulfs Jowr's arm in its oxterproglia.  Despite his screams, it quickly swallows him whole with a "slimy slthwip."  The Peeve vibrates, turns black, glows green, and shrinks, before spitting out Jowr's championship ring.  Then, it lays a large, metallic blue egg. 

Filled with a strange mix of terror and relief, Runt gently stows the egg and then lifts the now vulnerable-seeming Peeve back into its tank.  A profound bond and understanding wash over her; she accepts her responsibility as Keeper.  The story ends with Runt petting The Peeve as they sing together."></img></a>

				<p>In a subterranean world ruled by tradition, Runt is an outcast in her own family. When her father’s archaic will forces her into a new role, she becomes the reluctant Keeper of the clan’s most sacred—and repulsive—creature: The Peeve. Her duty is disgusting, but as Runt’s secret passion for song awakens a strange power within the creature, she uncovers a terrifying secret that devours the unsuspecting. In the deepest caverns, some traditions are meant to be broken, and some secrets are hungry.</p>
