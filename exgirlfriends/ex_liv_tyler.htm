                                      for &quot;One Night at McCools&quot;, I
                                      was invited to do the casting. There was
                                      only one girl on my mind for the role of
                                      Jewel, and that was Liv. I called her up,
                                      asked her out to dinner, and we
                                      immediately hit it off. She too was into
                                      the card game &quot;Magic the
                                      Gathering&quot;.
                                      We had many great times together; she
                                      incinerated my elves, and I in turn,
                                      attacked her with my blastoderm on
                                      multiple occasions. Our relationship was
                                      pure bliss, unfortunately
                                      however, fate besmirched me once again,
                                      and she had to return to England to play a
                                      pixie of some sort in the upcoming feature
                                      film &quot;Lord of the
