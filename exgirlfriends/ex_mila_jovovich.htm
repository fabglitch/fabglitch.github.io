                                      ancient language of the Gods in &quot;the 5th Element&quot; we had been
                                      attracted to each other, but there really
                                      wasn't anything other than that between
                                      us. It may seem crude, but that is why I
                                      turned to her after Liv and I broke up.
                                      Mila was without a doubt a rebound
                                      relationship; a momentary solace for my
                                      wounded heart... but oh the fun we had!!!
                                      When we weren't experimenting with various
                                      sexual positions, we were out doing
                                      research for her role as Jill in the
                                      upcoming Resident Evil movie. She wanted
                                      to know what the zombie's motivation would
                                      be, so we went around attempting to
                                      cannibalize people. Technically, we're
                                      still going out, but I haven't returned
                                      her calls for months.</td>
