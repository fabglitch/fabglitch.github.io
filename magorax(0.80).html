<div><br/><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Atop the irregular and challenging terrain of a craggy hill, beneath the domain of a solitary giant oak, a formidable figure stands tall, their sparkling eyes&nbsp;keenly overlooking a corpse-strewn battlefield as shade fades and grim deathmists dissipate.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">The first light of dawn breaks through the clouds and gently kisses the figure’s black war-paint smeared face: Sturdy jaw, like chiseled stone; deep-blue chin-beard, braided and bloodstained.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">His bare hairless chest heaves, exhausted, but his loins remain girded.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">These loins belong to I, Magorax</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">I, Magorax, survey the spattered battlefield upon which I am the last standing.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Smoke still rises from smoldering embers. The ground is littered with the broken bodies of soldiers, their blood soaking the earth and staining it a sickly shade.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Adjusting stance, my four lightly armored legs trample the pristine satiny-green grasses beneath my hooves. My tail flicks as the morning breeze tickles my bright-purple hide-hair. My powerful hearts pound as though I were at the height of battle, and yet-</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">Nothing but me stirs</span></p>
<div><br/><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">I, Magorax, am a Centaur</span><span class="text-negative-bold">[99:M:BattleMaster]</span><span class="text-normal">. My speed, ranged weaponry, and carrying capacity, bestow a tactical edge. Additionally, I’m eight feet tall and sport a two-foot-long dong. My hefty peen and scrote are suspended underneath, horsey-style, safely between my back legs, as opposed to precariously dangling up front; a design decision that would be an aesthetic—not to mention strategic—failure.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">My strat? Intimidate on a pre-conscious primal level. Decisive, elegant, aggressive, and dominant; commanding respect from allies and enemies both; I, Magorax, am an Alpha.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">This world belongs to me.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">Why then do I, Magorax, throb to the beat of fear?</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Beneath the rhythms of my excited hearts, silence saturates.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Memories of past victories. Only a select few remain distinct. Details faded like old scars, but emotions fresh like open wounds. Those victories feel different. Today, there is an emptiness.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">This game is not yet over</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Cantering, I, Magorax, circle the giant oak clockwise. I scan the horizon for movement.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">To the East, the Sun executes its rising routine, embracing the plains with warmth. Light glints off of discarded weapons and armor casting suspect shadows on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">North, to my rear, an impenetrable forest. West and South, lay the sorry husks of the slain.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">I pause my breathing; my chest stops heaving. I glance up into the still leaves of the tree above, then back out over the battlefield.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">I listen deeply—the gentle morning breeze seems to have ceased.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">A disembodied voice warns,</span></p>
<div class="more"> 
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-bold">Danger</span></p>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">I, Magorax, flinch—startled by the ethereal sound of the distant, and yet very present voice. My every purple hair stands at alert. Indeed, the voice is correct; there is a danger: Though I hold the high ground, I am vulnerable.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">I circle the tree once more then stop to again look over the battlefield. I grit my teeth and steel myself, eyes straining, observing only stillness. I reach into my custom </span><span class="text-bold">TheNailLeatherCo FannyPack</span><span class="text-normal">, then equip my <span class="text-bold">Glass Longbow</span>. From my quiver, I select a </span><span class="text-bold">Fleetwood-Boggle Arrow</span><span class="text-normal">.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Crafting items was not a skill-tree I, Magorax, trained. This uniquely crafted projectile was a gift from friends of an even rarer quality. I tap the shaft of the artesian arrow against my glass bow. The impact emits a clack—the clack, clacks-back from the battlefield.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">There should be no echo</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">“What are you waiting for?” I bellow. Rearing up, I kick out my front legs and bray, “Come at me, brrrrwuuugh!” The impromptu taunt, though intimidatingly delivered, rings hollow. Out of character.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Only my echo responds.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">I follow up with a haughty, “Ha-ha!” as subterfuge, cloaking rising anxiety. My hooves thunder back to the ground, distributing force throughout my sturdy muscular form, my scrote jiggles, and my peen pendulums left and right like meaty clockwork. Blood pumping, the timings of my hearts are comparatively irregular.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.25in;"><br/></span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Irregular like the echo</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.25in;"><br/></span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.25in;">At last, I, Magorax, make sense of what my exquisitely sensitive body is telling me.</span><br/></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">“We’ll play it your way,” I mutter, drawing back my bowstring. I aim at the sky above the battlefield and exert maximum pull. Sweat trickles down my nose as I hold One-Hundred-Fifty units of bow-force.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Nervously, I thumb the arrow’s soft red cockatrice-feather fletching, giving my cowardly unseen enemy a couple more seconds to make their move.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">My </span><span class="text-bold">Fleetwood Boggle Arrow</span><span class="text-normal"> has a specific purpose: At apex, the red cockatrice feathers guiding its flight will effect a fiery explosion spreading Boggle dust over the greatest possible range, negating any active magic.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">I’m eager to see its effect. With all magic negated, my battle master skills and ridiculous stats shall give me the edge over all but the strongest opponents. But surely my hearts do not drum this fiercely with mere anticipation. The inner truth of my excitement, a smouldering fear of the unknown.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Ceasing to hold back, I neigh, “Die like a coward then!”</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">The bow sounds a </span><span class="text-bold-italic">thwonk</span><span class="text-normal"> the fleetwood flies.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">I, Magorax, count aloud, “Eighteen. Seventeen. Sixteen,” meanwhile, producing three silver arrows. Straining to look into the middle-distance, my estimate of my echo’s point of reflection, I rest the arrows between each of the fingers on my left hand.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">My hearts thrash spastically as my count continues, “…ten. Nine.”</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">The familiar ethereal feminine voice repeats,</span></p>
<div class="more"> 
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-bold-italic">Danger</span></p>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">The voice’s volume increases, conveying a sort of vaguely urgent concern. I, Magorax, ignore the voice and complete my count, “…two. One. Zero.”</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Far overhead, the arrow combusts. A shimmering parabolic umbra descends upon the entire battlefield like a skirt of glitter.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Thirty paces South-East, my echo’s point of reflection, magical sparks illuminate the surface of a previously invisible monolith. Towering like a parapet; much larger than any enemy I, Magorax, can defeat with mere arrows and a greatsword.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">Bly-scnharr! It’s huge!</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">The obscured object unfolds, mechanically roaring and twanging as it attunes its orientation to fix on me. Its clanking carapace glimmers with a cold electric sizzle. The object’s barely visible surface shatters into scale-like shielding that shifts backward in waves while I, Magorax, stand motionless.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">What… is… it?</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">As if to answer my thought the juggernaut spins toward me tearing up the ground between us. It surges through the battlefield, obliterating everything in its path.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Momentarily mesmerized by this thundering thingamabob, I, Magorax, attempt to comprehend it as it shifts shape.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Flashing metallic coils spring outward, whirling and whanging; like glittering tendrils. Its shape cycles: now sharp, twisting, and rolling. The mass roars and hisses as it somehow spirals forward into itself transmuting the discernible into a spectral nothingness.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Unable to focus on it; it evades perception as though refringent through a dark crystal. Its form; amorphous and confusing.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Indecipherable.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">Something… not of this world</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Closer, its constantly warping form morphs into a rippling maelstrom of blades. Whatever-it-is, shifts more rapidly than my eyes can track, other than to know it’s moving toward me.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">Too fast</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">From the aether, the lady-voice irritatingly calls out for a third time,</span></p>
<div class="more"> 
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-bold-italic">Danger!</span></p>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">Danger, indeed</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">This is no magic I’ve ever seen. It cannot be magic; my boggle dust has seen to it. Only five seconds ago, the arrow had detonated. Already, this beast is within twenty paces.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">Too close</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">My powerful highly-trained muscles spring into action. Galloping, I put the tree between myself and the advancing cloud of blooming metal. My hurried pace propelled by a certainty that any further delay will introduce me to my oblivion.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Employing the most powerful tactic of all—surprise—I command, “Fire!”</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">The air disappears in an ear-splitting flash, erupting from the oak branches above. The incredible blast projects into the direct center of the indefinable distortion. That blast, is immediately followed by a much larger secondary impact explosion.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">The shockwave hits I, Magorax. My torso is partially protected by the tree’s trunk, but my hindquarters are pulverized; vital connective tissues temporarily liquefied. All four of my legs snap beneath; bones crack and joints pop. My face and dick hit the dirt simultaneously, at such speed that I, Magorax don't feel the pain.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">The distorted beast disintegrates with a vaporous </span><span class="text-bold-italic">*plip*</span><span class="text-normal">. Its sizzling, hissing, clanging, and whirling cease—the only sound remaining is the high-pitched squeal of my perforated eardrums.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">I, Magorax, regain focus on the sky above me; smoke clearing as ash particles of 10,000 vaporized leaves drift. The mighty oak laid bare, bark blasted away. Within the scorched branches: Two goblins and a spent </span><span class="text-bold">KarkNarBoomCo Shock Cannon</span><span class="text-normal">.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">The goblins descend from the tree like heavily armored squirrels. They remove their metal gloves and helmets as they scramble toward me.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">I look up at the goblins; their charred armor smoldering and sparking. I can’t hear them, but their thin gobliny lips move in unison. They join hands, attempting to cast a healing spell.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-bold" style="text-indent: 0.25in;"><br/></span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-bold" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">Grelnak</span><span class="text-negative-bold" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">[43:M:Warlock]</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.25in;">, and </span><span class="text-bold" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">Sleenklur</span><span class="text-negative-bold" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">[36:F:Berzerker]</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.25in;">, are my allies.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.25in;">Fellow adventurers.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.25in;">More than that, they are my friends.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Grelnak leads the chant. A stout 3'2", 110lbs. Like all goblins in the World of Pathena, he has gold-green eyes and red skin, horizontally striped with handsome camouflage of an even deeper red hue. Grelnak sports a mustache, hanging below his nose like an extravagantly bristled broom, protected from the elements by a custom bronze guard, anchored to a piercing through his septum. A sparse crown of unprotected black hair surrounds his battle-scarred dome.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Especially fierce in his youth, his scars were souvenirs of skirmishes, before he was adopted by brownies and taught the benefits to tempering aggressive impulses. Controlled temperament permits greater concentration, and all the bonuses, buffs, and perks that brings.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Adult goblins under thirty are uncommonly strong for creatures of their size, but so too are they uncommonly impulsive and destructive. Older than sixty, and they are wise enough to master spell-casting, but entirely too weak to engage in melee combat.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Being a middle-level goblin, Grelnak occupies the sweet spot between strong-young-dumb, and weak-old-wise. His warlock abilities have saved my hide on countless campaigns.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Joining in Grelnak’s chant, is his berzerker love-mate, Sleenklur. Her intensity augments any experience.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Standing 3'5", and 90 pounds, Sleenklur is leaner and stronger than Grelnak. This is partly due to age, and partly to upbringing. She hails from a warrior clan of mountain goblins. Typical for her clan, her skin is a pinker shade of red, displaying a cute pattern of banded stripes.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Sleenklur’s cuteness cloaks an explosive temper. If agitated enough, red steam shoots out of her ears. She’s a berserker—and not just in battle.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">On one occasion, I, Magorax, had the pleasure to witness a drunken rogue pull back a stump after getting grabby. Hard liquor and Sleenklur’s full goblin mode is a combustible combo.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Managing the emotional states of goblins is a great skill to have. Grelnak uniquely possesses the ability to de-escalate Sleenklur should anything get her blood boiling. And I, Magorax, am talented at elevating both of their moods.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Entertaining each other with hilarious jokes and fantastic tales. Helping when in need; united against common enemies. Journeying together; experiencing epic escapades and ecstasies.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Their weird bodies, proportioned in slightly different ratios. Tight, tough skin, stretched over even tighter and tougher muscle. An aesthetically pleasing highly evolved form; though they be tiny, they're mature and powerful. Something about their lack of nipples entangles the eye in a pleasant way. A tiny subversion of mammalian expectation. Looking at them fills one with an impressed feeling, as though looking at a magnificent artwork.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">But also, they possess a sort of sickliness compelling compassion, filling one with an urge to care for them. To accept the dares and challenges of navigating potentially explosive situations. Willingly exposing oneself to potentially harmful experiences, while trusting any connection you build in the moment is worth more than any bridge you might burn in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">A Goblins’ charm comes from this perceived risk; the peak experience that lay betwixt the depths of danger and desire.</span></p>

<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Sleenklur, Grelnak, and I, Magorax, are bonded to one another as only true adventurers can be.</span></p>
<div><br/><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">I, Magorax, gaze upon my two goblin comrades chanting over me. Grelnak emotes a frown of concern. In all our adventures, this is the first time I have seen him from this vantage point. Looking up at him, my vision blurs then again refocuses on the glittering tip of my nose. Tiny magical sparks continue to dance around Grelnak’s enchanted blast armor.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">As boggle dust settles all over my formerly full-health body, pain finally registers accompanied by intense nausea. I inhale a sweet bloody breath seasoned by my singed hairs, and reluctantly accept reality.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">I, Magorax, lay broken</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">The distant ethereal voice—somehow everywhere—again calls out with an air of impatience,</span></p>
<div class="more"> 
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-bold-italic">DANGER!</span></p>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">No shit</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">With subsequent breaths my battered chest inflates less and less.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">Why, though deafened, do I hear this danger-voice?</span></p>
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">What is this strange beast that has felled me?</span></p>
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">And, what is the answer to the Enigma of Chrome?</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">These things—I, Magorax—will never know. My boggle dust has seen to it; negating my goblin friends’ healing magic.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">My hearts cease their pounding and I exhale my final painful breath. Grelnak’s gold and green eyes meet mine; a shared look, conveying all that needs to be said. Below his ornate bronze stash armor, his gobliny lips grimace in sad realization of the truth of the moment.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Sleenklur, Grelnak, and I, Magorax: Countless adventures. Innumerable triumphs, like the time we led the distraction raid for the Alliance of the Western Plains, and were so successful we opened up a whole new front, a decisive part of ending the second Eternal War. Or the time we rescued the heir to the Southern Throne, accepted the reward, then blew it all on pixie dust.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Together, we lived life; and now, together, we meet my death.</span></p>
<div><br/><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Before closing my eyes for the last time, I receive the rarest gift of all; the rainbow tinted tears of great goblin friends.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Then, there is nothing.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Not even darkness.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">No—there is still an empty pain. A vessel for a trickle of thought and its thinker to pour in. A narrative stream emerges and existence surges. A billion hexagonal bubbles of light focus on a wave in the abyssal distance.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">The wave curls and crashes into a frothing foam of hexagons. My experiences linger like a burning phosphor, then submerge in darkness.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">A salty taste.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">A sizzle.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">A </span><span class="text-bold-italic">plip.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">Atop my existence, another overlays itself—it had been there all along.</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
 <p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">This has happened before</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">I, Magorax, do not resist.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">I'm calm as though returning home.</span><br/></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">I embrace another layer of existence.</span></p>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">My story ends, but I become a part of something bigger.<br/></span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal">And then,</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-center-normal"><span class="text-italic">Hiccup</span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="p-left-indent"><span class="text-normal"><span class="text-normal">Alyss</span> is conscious again.</span></p>
