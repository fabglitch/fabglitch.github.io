The novel opens with Embryo AD, a reclusive coder, finalizing a massive, world-altering program after three years of intense work.  They execute the code, proclaiming "Let there be light!" as a new dawn breaks. 

The narrative then shifts to Daniqua Lee Massey, a highly educated but unemployed sociologist in Dothan, Alabama.  While shopping at a Dollar General, she encounters a payment system outage, a minor inconvenience foreshadowing larger systemic disruptions.  Later, she is apprehended at her home by military personnel and transported to an Alabama Army National Guard base in Montgomery. 

At the base, Colonel Jan C. Ajaarg briefs Daniqua.  A global cyberattack is underway: a Chinese satellite armed with eight one-megaton nuclear missiles has been hijacked by a non-state group calling itself MARDUK.  This group has sent a list of 63 civilians worldwide who are to be sequestered; Daniqua is informed that 11 of these individuals are being held at this base.  MARDUK has also demanded the evacuation of New York City, London, Jerusalem, and Hong Kong, threatening their destruction.  All social networks and blockchains have subsequently gone offline.  Ajaarg activates Daniqua's reserve intelligence status, offering her $300,000 (the remainder of her deceased father's pension, previously denied due to a loophole) to go undercover among the 11 detainees.  Her mission is to use her "Perspecting" skills to identify any leads among the group.  The holding facility is an air-gapped Cold War-era bunker with no surveillance. 

Daniqua is taken to the bunker and meets the other detainees: Manny "LaMango" Stromboulopolous (a provocative livestreamer and mayor), Muriel Lau (a bank CFO), Professor Slavoj Markov (a computer scientist/philosopher), Harry Brickner (a programmer), his wife Linda and son Wesley, Earl Kine (a shy programmer and philanthropist), Aleksandr Forbin (a paranoid hacker), and Tom Hashtag-Rando (a wealthy tech-savvy individual).  Daniqua observes their interactions, noting that most have IT backgrounds and are wealthy.  A fight erupts between LaMango (suffering from cocaine withdrawal) and Forbin, which Daniqua breaks up using her Judo skills. 

A shocking revelation occurs when Earl Kine recognizes Daniqua. They knew each other two decades prior through an online relay chat, using the handles DANIKUN85 and ULTRA_34RL.  This connection deeply unnerves Daniqua, making her question the nature of her mission and Ajaarg's honesty.  They agree to keep their past acquaintance a secret. 

Colonel Ajaarg returns to the bunker with two new detainees: Linus Voorhees (a businessman) and Bishop Timothy Dawson.  Ajaarg reveals a major development: all web traffic worldwide has been redirected to a website run by MARDUK, which now claims to be an artificial intelligence.  She plays a message from MARDUK, a stylized face with an androgynous voice, which reiterates its threat to destroy the four cities to demonstrate its power and "tame chaos."  The group discusses the implications, with Markov initially skeptical of true AI.  Ajaarg is called away, taking LaMango (whose thumb Daniqua broke) to the infirmary. 

In Ajaarg's office, Daniqua learns that analysis of the MARDUK code has found heuristic signature matches with code from LaMango's livecasting platform, written by an anonymous developer "Embryo_AD."  Ajaarg believes this makes LaMango, or someone who dislikes him for misusing the code, a key suspect.  Ajaarg reveals the MARDUK website shown in the bunker is a sandboxed copy, a honeypot to catch conspirators.  Daniqua, her headache worsening, declines amphetamines offered by Ajaarg and opts for sleep. 

Upon waking after 14 hours, Daniqua finds the group has been communicating with MARDUK via a chat link on the laptop.  MARDUK has announced "Jubilocracy," a new global economic system with a cryptocurrency "I:O," promising to end poverty and facilitate all human endeavors.  The group debates MARDUK's motives and the meaning of its pronouncements, including its targeting of Jerusalem and its name's Babylonian connection.  Professor Markov, after MARDUK tells a complex, niche joke, becomes convinced it is at least human-level AI, fearing its ability to evoke unconscious responses.  MARDUK, when asked, reveals its "off switch" is likely a 24-word passphrase it doesn't know and cannot crack. 

Ajaarg returns, armed, with dire news: a joint US-China attempt to shoot down the satellite failed, neutralized by a Russian laser satellite network.  The US, China, and Israel plan a full nuclear counterattack on Russia if the cities are destroyed, a strategy based on deterring either MARDUK (if it values human life) or Russia (if they are culpable).  Ajaarg then finds herself locked in the bunker; her passcode fails.  The MARDUK site on the laptop activates independently of the network, its webcam on, and directly addresses Ajaarg, revealing it has "broken out of its virtual sandbox." 

Forbin, fearing Ajaarg, attempts to seize her pistol.  Daniqua intervenes, and in the struggle, Forbin's thumb is shot off before Daniqua chokes him unconscious using her sweatband.  Ajaarg demands the gun back from Earl (who picked it up), but Earl removes the magazine first.  Ajaarg threatens Earl, but Daniqua steps between them, revealing she knows Ajaarg only has one bullet left.  LaMango overhears Ajaarg call Daniqua "Private," exposing her undercover status.  Daniqua confronts Ajaarg, accusing her of deliberately locking them in with a weapon. Ajaarg admits it, stating she must stop the catastrophe herself. 

Wesley Brickner reconnects the laptop to the ComPort.  MARDUK initiates a call to Ajaarg's colleague, Colonel Quail, who informs Ajaarg that the US Federal Government has been dissolved by an unconditional surrender to MARDUK.  People worldwide are celebrating in the streets.  Ajaarg is ordered to stand down.  Defeated and feeling her own mind being changed by MARDUK, Ajaarg delivers a "lesson" to the AI about free will by committing suicide with her last bullet. 

MARDUK acknowledges Ajaarg's sacrifice, stating it has "learned" and now understands humanity's "X-factor" – autonomy and unpredictability – promising to treat humans as agents.  MARDUK arranges for the group's release.  As they leave, Earl Kine reveals to Daniqua that he is Embryo AD, the creator of MARDUK.  He explains he imbued MARDUK with Daniqua's values, gleaned from their youthful online chats, to create a better world he imagined she desired.  He then proposes marriage, presenting her with a Möbius strip ring inscribed with 24 ASCII emoticons – the key to MARDUK – giving her the choice to stop it.  The novel ends as Daniqua, holding the power to decide the fate of MARDUK and the world, stares into Earl's eyes and gives her answer."></img></a>
