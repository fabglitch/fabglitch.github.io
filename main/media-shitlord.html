"Shitlord In the Anus of Madness" plunges into a near-future dystopia where societal norms have been grotesquely reshaped by the "Microbiome Revolution."  The protagonist, Shia, is a faded celebrity grappling with existential dissatisfaction and a prolonged creative decline.  In this world, the consumption of "The Product"—processed human feces sourced from elite individuals and celebrities—has become a widespread health and status phenomenon, promising optimized personalities, moods, and even IQ.  This practice, known as "nomming," is ubiquitous. 

Shia himself is a "nommer," dependent on an increasingly rare premium brand, AnnaliseB®-2031.  His life takes a bizarre turn when, cleaning out his recently moved parents' old condo, he rediscovers two dozen jars of his own feces, frozen over twenty years ago during his "prime-of-my-life-poop" for an art project he no longer remembers.  With his usual Product source drying up, Shia impulsively begins consuming his vintage stool, rehydrating it with oatmeal. 

This self-experiment triggers a profound internal war.  He endures severe constipation, lethargy, and drastic mood swings as the microbiota from his youth battles the designer flora he’s been ingesting.  After a week, this internal conflict culminates in a massive bowel movement in a public washroom, which brings an unexpected clarity and a feeling of awakening, as if he’s his true self for the first time in years.  He experiences heightened senses and unsettling lapses in consciousness, where he performs complex tasks on autopilot. 

Despite this newfound vitality, an old craving for AnnaliseB® surfaces, driving him to seek out his dealer, Dr. Puckerie, in Battery Park.  There, he witnesses Puckerie frantically fleeing from a Special Cybernetic Attack Team (S.C.A.T.).  Puckerie ditches a black metallic briefcase, which Shia, through a series of coincidences involving being knocked down by the pursuing SCAT agents, ends up possessing.  Gunfire erupts, and Puckerie is presumably neutralized. 

Inside the case, Shia finds not drugs or weapons, but a rye bread sandwich, apple slices, and a blue binder containing an internal report from Soylent Brown Corporation (SBC), the leading manufacturer of The Product.  The report details an alarming trend: "Microbiota Monoculture."  It reveals that the top eleven commercial Product brands, accounting for 95% of global consumption, are rapidly converging, projected to be 98% similar within a year.  Shia, misinterpreting this as a problem SBC would want to solve, sees an opportunity. He believes his unique, vintage "Shia®-2012" Product can offer much-needed diversity and catapult him back to fame.  He mails the damning report to his mother for safekeeping. 

Feeling confident and purposeful, Shia shaves, dons an expensive suit, and heads to SBC headquarters to propose his own Product line.  He meets Lars (Dr. Vagus), an SBC executive, and his imposing assistant, Björn.  Lars launches into a polished monologue praising nomming for achieving "socio-moral equilibrium" and solving societal problems, dismissing the monoculture report as "dangerous and misleading information."  He reveals that monoculture is, in fact, SBC’s ultimate goal.  When Lars offers Shia a lifetime supply of Product in exchange for the "harmful documents," Shia, enraged by the dismissal and fueled by his old spite, reveals he doesn’t have the report and that his case is full of his own Product.  Realizing his grave miscalculation, Shia violently attacks Lars with a slice of cake and Björn with the briefcase and a fork, then flees deeper into the facility. 

His escape route takes him through the Replicator floor, where he uncovers the horrifying truth behind SBC's mass production: not sterile machinery, but hundreds of morbidly obese, pale, intubated humans, continuously fed a slurry and power-defecating into industrial bins.  These "Replicators" are the source of The Product. Shia is overcome with revulsion, understanding now that humanity has become a "substrate," easily controlled through a homogenized microbiome. 

Shia escapes the building as SCAT vans arrive.  He runs, his mind flashing to utopian ideals from Star Trek where humanity transcended such bodily functions.  He boards a ferry, mistakenly believing it’s bound for New Jersey, only to discover it’s a tourist boat heading to Liberty Island.  An attack helicopter closes in; Shia throws his WrAssist (a personal communicator with GPS) overboard, but it’s too late. 

On Liberty Island, SCAT troopers disembark from the helicopter.  As they command everyone to halt, Shia attempts to blend in but stumbles.  His briefcase bursts open, spilling his two dozen jars of "Shia®-2012" Product.  A small girl picks up one of the jars, and Shia whispers to her to hide it and keep it safe, calling it "special."  He tries to flee but is shot by SCAT.  Dying at the foot of the Statue of Liberty, with his life flashing before his eyes, Shia gathers his last strength to shout his final, desperate warning to the world: "SOYLENT BROWN… IS MADE… BY POOPLE!"></img></a>

				<p>Welcome to the world of the Microbiome Revolution, where your personality, success, and social status are determined by whose shit you eat. For Shia, a former A-lister on a steady decline , life is a passive haze until he rediscovers his "vintage" 20-year-old self-produced product. The experience reboots his consciousness and leads him to the horrifying secret behind Soylent Brown Corporation's miracle supplement. In a society pacified by designer digestion, Shia becomes a lone warrior fighting a disgusting, world-altering truth that could restore humanity or get him flushed.</p>
