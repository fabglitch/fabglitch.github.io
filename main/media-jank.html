"Jank" by Fabrina Glitchlace is presented as a transcript of Episode 389 of "The Omega Phi Podcast," titled "The Honor of Scumbags,"  hosted by the pseudonymous M'Ycell MacGyver.  The episode begins with M'Ycell's standard podcast introduction, including an apology for previous "insensitive" memes,  before segueing into the central theme: the nature and experience of "Honor." 

The narrative then shifts to a detailed account of a Friday evening. M'Ycell and his protégé, Emmanuelle (Emm), whom he is mentoring in a philosophical and skill-based discipline he calls "The Way,"  journey through the city towards a trading card game tournament.  "The Way" encompasses memory mastery, mind-reading, stoicism, statistics, probability manipulation, and destiny crafting.  Their walk takes them through "DogShit Park,"  amidst the urban sensory details of a late November evening. 

Upon arriving at the "temple" or arena,  a space filled with books, manga, and gaming tables,  M'Ycell and Emm register for the tournament.  While waiting, they observe an intense exhibition match between two players, "Baldy" and "The Kid," which serves as a demonstration of high-level play, psychological tactics, and the complex decision-making involved in the game. M'Ycell also spots Leonard "Lenny" Skeltal, a renowned and ethical trader, engaging in a high-value exchange.  This observation prompts M'Ycell to reflect on Lenny's fair trading philosophy  and the economic impact of "Mythic Rare" cards on the game's community and accessibility. 

Emm encounters a college friend, Windy,  who introduces them to Helga Vindjakker.  M'Ycell forms an immediate negative impression of Helga,  but she engages Emm in conversation about player archetypes ("Spike, Timmy, Johnny")  and astrology. 

The tournament draft begins, and M'Ycell delves into the intricacies of this format, emphasizing its skill-intensive nature.  He reflects on his long history with the game, its connection to "The Way,"  and the almost spiritual experience of playing. He meticulously selects his cards, building a black-red deck with a splash of blue,  while Emm also drafts a promising deck. 

The tournament progresses through several rounds. M'Ycell wins his first match against Morton Sheng 2-0.  He notes Emm's good sportsmanship in allowing an opponent a "take-back," even as she secures a win.  In his second round, M'Ycell faces Mateo Crabone, who employs an unconventional "milling" strategy (forcing M'Ycell to run out of cards in his deck) and defeats him.  M'Ycell, despite the loss, admires Crabone's "gall." 

The narrative culminates in M'Ycell's third-round match against Trevor, a player with a "Champion" playmat signifying considerable skill.  After splitting the first two games, the deciding third game goes into overtime.  Trevor plays a powerful, multi-colored mythic rare card.  M'Ycell experiences a moment of clarity: he recognizes the card, and the distinctive pink sleeve it's in,  as the very one he witnessed Trevor trading for with Lenny Skeltal before the draft began and placing into his binder.  This means Trevor could not have legitimately drafted the card for this tournament.

M'Ycell carefully confronts Trevor, asking if he drafted the card.  Trevor affirms, then claims he drafted it "during this draft."  M'Ycell then asks Trevor to show the other copy he must have in his trade binder, in the same sleeve, in the center position of page two.  Trevor, cornered, retrieves his binder, revealing the empty slot.  He confesses, "I guess you win." 

M'Ycell, his anger justified and boiling over, erupts, "YOU SCUMBAG!"  Emm, who was watching, confirms M'Ycell's keen observation.  Trevor attempts to make excuses, claiming it was his first time cheating and a moment of weakness,  but M'Ycell sees through the premeditated nature of the act.  Enraged by the betrayal of honor, especially from someone with a "Champion" playmat, M'Ycell banishes him: "You have no honor. BEGONE!"  Trevor skulks away. 

Following this dramatic confrontation, M'Ycell reflects deeply on the meaning of honor, its intrinsic nature, and its connection to "The Way." Emm then surprises M'Ycell by announcing she's dropping from the tournament, despite being undefeated, to go with Helga for a tarot reading.  This forces M'Ycell to reassess his initial negative judgment of Helga. 

M'Ycell wins his final match, finishing the tournament 3-1.  He explains that his detection of Trevor's cheating wasn't due to a photographic memory, as some now believe,  but because his adherence to "The Way" made him "open to it."  He recalls the specific card art involved in the cheating incident, which was particularly memorable to him for personal reasons.

The podcast episode concludes with M'Ycell musing on his role as a "prophet" of "The Way,"  the growth of his audience,  his commitment to continue as long as there's a "thirsty" listenership,  and an announcement for the next week's "Ask Me Anything" episode.  He signs off with his full, elaborate title."></img></a>
